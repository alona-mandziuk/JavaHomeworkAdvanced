When Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking JAVA  JAVA  bed,
he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window JAVA  the opaque walls JAVA  his chamber.
He was endeavouring JAVA  pierce the darkness JAVA  his ferret eyes,
when the chimes JAVA  a neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened JAVA  the hour.
To his great astonishment the heavy bell went JAVA  JAVA  six JAVA  seven,
and JAVA  seven JAVA  eight, and regularly JAVA  JAVA  twelve; then stopped. Twelve.
